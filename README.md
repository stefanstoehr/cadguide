# cadgui.de

https://cadgui.de or https://stefanstoehr.github.io/cadguide/ is used to tell a visual story of my intention to catch computer aided designs provided by architects and engineers and transfer it to digital worlds (e.g. games, simulations, vr, metaverses), where it can implemented and (re)build again and again and... as a second, third, fourth... income for the architects and engineers.
